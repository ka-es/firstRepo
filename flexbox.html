                <h2>Designed by a 28-year-old first-time developer, this RPG-style game has an addictive quality that’s making people take notice.</h2>

                <p>Stardew Valley is a country-life simulator. Your character has inherited the family farm, and gameplay consists of learning to live off the land as time slowly passes. You can spend time growing crops, raising livestock, fishing, cooking, working on your home, befriending fellow townspeople—all with no real aim except creating a thriving homestead for your character. It might sound like it would get boring fast, but Stardew Valley is strangely satisfying. Its intricate, pixelated graphics are lush and colourful, and the quietly engaging gameplay shows off a careful attention to detail. </p>

            <h2>Things You Should Know About 2016’s Best Game: Stardew Valley</h2>

                <h3>It’s number two on Steam’s list of best-selling games.</h3>
                <p>Online gaming retailer Steam currently ranks Stardew Valley as its second-best top seller. This puts the game in the company of titles from blockbuster gaming franchises like Tom Clancy, Counter-Strike, and GTA. This ranking would be an achievement for any new game. It’s even more impressive given who’s behind Stardew Valley…</p>
            </div>
            <div class="thing">
                <h3>It was created solo by a first-time developer.</h3>
                <p>Stardew Valley is the work of Eric Barone, a Seattle-based 28-year-old. After graduating from his computer science program at the University of Washington-Tacoma in 2011, Barone had trouble finding a coding job. So, he decided to develop and release an indie game, as a fun little project to add to his resume. Barone initially planned to just release the finished product on Xbox Live Indie Games, but once he got down to work, he became invested in the game and decided he wanted to take things further. Barone spent the next four years working full-time on Stardew Valley.</p>

                <h3>It was inspired by the classic farming simulator game Harvest Moon.</h3>
                <p>Released for the SNES in North America 1997, the Japanese game Harvest Moon was the original country-life simulator. It became a cult hit, beloved by fans for its simple yet rewarding gameplay, in which the player takes over a run-down farm and tries to bring it back to prosperity. Barone wanted to recreate the simplicity of Harvest Moon, saying in an interview with Vulture that “there was something about that relaxed gameplay in this immersive, beautiful world that felt really special.”</p>
